# 👶 Infant Mortality in Africa (2000–2023) – Power BI Project

This project explores **infant mortality trends across African countries** from 2000 to 2023 using data analytics and visualizations. The goal is to uncover patterns, identify countries with the highest and lowest mortality rates, and provide actionable recommendations that can support improvements in public health outcomes.

## 📌 Introduction

**Infant mortality**, the death of a child before their first birthday, remains a critical public health concern in many African countries. While progress has been made over the past few decades, the continent still faces some of the highest infant mortality rates globally due to factors such as poverty, poor access to healthcare, malnutrition, and limited infrastructure.

This project uses data from the **World Bank** to analyze trends over the last two decades and present a visual narrative on the state of infant health across Africa.

## 🛠️ Data Source & Preparation

1. **Source:**  
   Data was sourced from the [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.IMRT.IN) portal.

2. **Initial Format:**  
   The dataset included infant mortality rates for **all countries worldwide** from **1960 to 2023**.

3. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Filtered dataset to **African countries only**  
   - **Unpivoted** year columns into a single ‘Year’ column for tidy data formatting  
   - Removed null values and standardized country names  

4. **Analysis & Visualization:**  
   The cleaned data was imported into **Power BI** for dashboard creation. Four main visuals were developed:
   - **Top 3 African countries** with the lowest infant mortality rates in 2023  
   - **Top 10 countries** with the highest infant mortality rates (2000–2023)  
   - **Map visualization** showing countries with the lowest rates  
   - **Interactive slicers** for Year and Country

## 📊 Key Insights

- The **10 African countries** with the **highest infant mortality rates** from 2000 to 2023 are:
  **Somalia, South Sudan, Central African Republic, Sierra Leone, Chad, Niger, Mali, Guinea, Nigeria, and Liberia**.

- The **top 3 countries with the lowest infant mortality rates in 2023** are:
  - **Libya:** 10.2 per 1,000 live births  
  - **Cabo Verde:** 12 per 1,000  
  - **Mauritius:** 13.2 per 1,000

To reduce infant mortality across Africa, the following actions are recommended:

- Strengthen **maternal and newborn healthcare services**, especially in rural regions  
- Train and deploy **more skilled birth attendants** and healthcare professionals  
- Improve access to **nutrition and vaccination programs**  
- Invest in **healthcare infrastructure** and expand public health funding  
- Promote **community health education** and hygiene practices  
- Implement **data-driven policies** for better resource allocation and monitoring
